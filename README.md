**OCR USING GEN AI MODEL TO EXTRACT TEXT FROM IMAGES**

***WHY CHOOSE A GENERATIVE AI MODEL FOR TEXT EXTRACTION FROM IMAGES OVER TRADITIONAL OCR TECHNIQUES?***

Traditional OCR methods rely on standard/pre-defined fonts and layouts. Hence, they cannot perform very well on handwritten text, images of poor quality & unconventional document formats.

Gen AI models help in overcoming these limitations and are also faster.

Apart from reading text, Gen AI models also use NLP to answer user queries, thereby doing the job of both ‘text extraction’  and ‘specific data retrieval’.

Launched in May 2024, this open source model has been developed to perform multimodal tasks such as visual understanding, classification, summarization, and creating content from image and video.
